LEVELS - .MAP_LAYOUT FILES:

Map layout files are laid out in an easy-to-parse fashion:
    BLOCK_ID X Y W H

Each line is a block, described by which texture to use, and then the block's coordinates.
E.g.
    PLAT0 0 -1 10 5

^ Creates a 'PLAT0' block at [0, WINDOW_HEIGHT - 1, 10, 5].
All numbers are in meters (which are interpreted by the engine), and a negative number
is offset from the bottom of the screen instead of the top.
